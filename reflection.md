## Reflection

this project largely went well. We achieved both our MVP and some of our stretch goals (linking to Heroku and adding the request submission, linked to a slack channel). However, there was an unequal division of labour that we realized at a point that was not condusive to dividing it differently, which resulted in one of our members spending a significantly higher amount of time on the project than planned. They learned a lot and overall enjoyed it, but it would have been good to go in more evenly split.

We also didn't work together as a team very often, which had its upsides and its downsides. We didn't have to wait until a scheduled point to work on separate pieces before we unified, but it also meant it was harder to pick up where someone else had left off and there was a little more uncertainty. When we did work together, we often made some decent progress in not-too-long a period of time.

### Personal Reflections

#### Mackenzie: Deployment

	Here I will submit a write up of deployment.
  
	Basically I followed [John Kagga’s tutorial](https://medium.com/@johnkagga/deploying-a-python-flask-app-to-heroku-41250bda27d0).

And then troubleshooted 

#### Kaitlyn: Testing

Initially, a large part of the testing I did was not based on an automated system, but tended more to debugging. This is particularly true of server-side things. However, I attempted to figure out pytest, a tool which I haven’t used before, by imitating the setup in the library’s repo and looking up online documentation. I also got to talk with Oliver about how testing and debugging works on servers, particularly in the long term, which was something I had no context for before.

I wish I'd been more proactive about seeking ways to help out on the implementation. I still learned a good amount about Twilio and Heroku. However, I feel like I could have loaded more of that to the front and been more useful throughout. I'm excited to explore both of these tools more going forward.
